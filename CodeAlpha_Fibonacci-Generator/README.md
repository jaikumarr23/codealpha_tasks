This Python script generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit entered by the user. 

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.

This script utilizes a recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers.

The fibonacci() function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

It employs a recursive approach, with a base case for when n is 0 or 1, returning n directly.

For larger values of n, it recursively calculates the Fibonacci number by summing the results of the function called with n-1 and n-2.

The script prompts the user to input the limit of the Fibonacci sequence they wish to generate.

It then iterates through numbers from 0 to the specified limit, calling the fibonacci() function for each index and printing the corresponding Fibonacci number in the sequence.

This script demonstrates a simple implementation of generating Fibonacci numbers using recursion, providing users with the flexibility to choose the length of the sequence they desire.
